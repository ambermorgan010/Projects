TEAMMATE NAMES: 

Steps 1 & 2
-----------

Just read and watch the demonstration.


Step 3: Hypothesize
-------------------

TODO: write your hypotheses here


Step 4: Create Experiment
-------------------------

Complete this in sorting.py. Nothing to write here.


Step 5: Gather Data
-------------------

Fill out the sheet on paper, no need to copy it here. No need to turn these numbers in.
You will ultimately put some of the data into plot.py as well.


Step 6: Data Analysis
---------------------

Assuming a magnitude of 1,000,000:

	Data set size when the two algorithms take about the same amount of time: TODO (closest multiple of 5)
    With data sets smaller than that number, is merge or insertion sort faster? insertion sort
    With data sets larger than that number, is merge or insertion sort faster? merge sort
	
	Data set size for insertion sort to sort in 3 seconds: TODO
	Data set size for merge sort to sort in 3 seconds: TODO

	Rank the three algorithms from fastest to slowest for small data sets:
	TODO
	
	Rank the three algorithms from fastest to slowest for large data sets:
	TODO

Then complete the plotting portion in plot.py.


Step 7: Conclusions
-------------------

TODO: for each hypothesis from step 2 state whether you think you demonstrated
it as true, false, or needs more research.

TODO: theorize about the relative efficiency of Timsort
