If you give a(n) __animal__ a(n) __food__, he/she is going to ask for a __noun__.
When you give him/her the __previous_noun_again__, he/she will want to __verb__. When he/she is
finished, he/she will __verb__. Then he/she will __verb__ and __verb__ to the __noun__. Since that
doesn't work out, he/she will want to go to __location__. On the way, he/she will see a(n) __noun__
and will want __noun__. Then you will have to take him/her to the __location__. He/she will
__verb__. When he/she is done, he/she will ask you for some __food__. On the way home he/she will
start a game of __game__. When you finally get home, you'll have to __verb__. and he will want a
__noun__. You'll have to find a __noun__ and __plural_noun__. When he/she sees the
__last_noun_again__, he/she will start __verb_ending_in_-ing__.  Then he/she will __verb__ out of
__plural_noun__. Of course, when he/she is finished he/she will want to __verb__. So he/she will ask
for a(n) __first_food__. Chances are if you give him/her a __first_food_again__, he/she is going to
want a(n) __first_food__.
