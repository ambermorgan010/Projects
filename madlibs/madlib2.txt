Hello, my fellow __plural_noun__ in 2020. It's me, George Washington, the first __occupation__. I am writing from
(the) __place__, where I have been secretly living for the past __number__ years. I am concerned by the
__adjective__ state of affairs in America these days. It seems that your politicians are more concerned with
__verb_ending_in_'ing'__ one another than with listening to the __plural_noun__ of the people. When we declared our
independence from (the) __place__, we set forth on a/an __adjective__ path guided by the voices of the everyday
__plural_noun__. Don't get me wrong: we had __adjective__ problems in my day, too. Benjamin Franklin once called
me a/an __noun__ and kicked me in the __body_part__. But at the end of the day, we were able to __verb__
in harmony. Let us find that __adjective__ spirit once again, or else I'm taking my __body_part__ off the quarter!
